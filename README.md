# Machine Learnings

An exploration into understanding how machines learn.

Some of this code is written by me, others are pulled from internet resources. I claim no ownership for code that wasn't
written by me.

## Getting started

```
python -m venv venv && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Projects

- **Regressions** - statistical, parametric, regression-based
- **Transformers** - transformer, self-attention

### Notebooks

These projects largely use Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate their functionality alongside prose that explains the code.
